This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj).
 
## My Approach 
I used the plain HTML and CSS for solving this.

Specifically, CSS Flexbox was my way to go.

## What I liked and learnt

To center the card, I set the body display to flex and gave it a min-height of 100vh. This was the game changer for me. Then I simply center aligned both the justify-content and align-items and it was straight in the center.

Giving the card some box-shadow was a cool effect and I liked it.

## Difficulties Faced

I think I could've improved on the typography and line height. I wish I could use the transition state for hover and focus, but I think it's still apparent that the buttons are interactive.

I struggled a bit with setting the color of the background image. I thought that I may need to use blend or something. However, it was as simple as setting the color to the appropriate value!

## Tips

My takeaway from this project for any newbies like me out there, for centering something like this, use flex on body, set min-height of 100vh and center align the justify-content and align-items.
And also, never give up. It's fun!
